\section{DES Weaknesses}
Weak keys: keys such that D=E. They are often blacklisted (?)

Semi-weak keys: keys such that D(k1, E(k2, m))

2DES has been theoretically proposed but broken since just $2^{57}$ bruteforce attempts are required to find the right key.
Not $2^{112}$ as expected.

3DES is mainly used in 2 different modes: DDD and DED, depending if three or two keys are used.
In the latter case a key is recycled for both the D and E block.

AES has been selected during an american competition. The original name of the algo was Rijndael.

AES is usually attacked non in the inner part (cipher) but in the boundary configuration (protocol).
