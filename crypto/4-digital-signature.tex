\subsection{Attacks}
What is my attack power?
 - modify strongly correlated messages
 - weakly correlated messages (bitflipped)
 - arbitrary message

Attacks:
- public nonce disclusure -> private key is easily worked out
- nonce reuse -> after 2 messages the private key can be obtained solving a system of equations
- correlated nonces (e.g., sequential ones, LCG generator)
