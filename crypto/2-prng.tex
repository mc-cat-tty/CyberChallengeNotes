\chapter{Pseudo-random Number Generator}
Marsenne Twister (MT) PRNG completes a cycle after $2^19937-1$ generated numebrs.

By observing enough iterations (624 words - 32 bits in MT19937 version) the structure of the generator can be deduced.

In Python, getting the internal state of the generator is as easy as calling \texttt{???}.
